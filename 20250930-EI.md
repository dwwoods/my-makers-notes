### Self Awareness
    Self-awareness is the foundational skill of emotional intelligence. It is the conscious knowledge of your own character, feelings, motives, and desires. It goes beyond simply having an emotion; it's the ability to step back and recognize it as it's happening.
    Think of it as having an internal observer. This observer doesn't just see what you're feeling, but also understands:

    Why you might be feeling that way: "I'm feeling irritable. It's probably because I had a poor night's sleep and have a deadline approaching."

    ow that feeling is manifesting: "I notice my jaw is tight and I'm speaking more abruptly than usual."

    The potential impact on others: This is the crucial part from your definition. "Because I'm irritable, I might come across as dismissive to my teammates. I need to be mindful of my tone in our next meeting."
