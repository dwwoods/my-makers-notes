# Python Reflections

Please pause at this point to reflect and review your learning...

In a few sentences, explain:

## What functions are
    Like a toaster - a named, reusable block of code designed to perform a single, specific task. 
## What arguments are.
    are pieces of information or data that you pass into a function when you call it. The function then uses these arguments to perform its task. For example, in print("Hello"), the string "Hello" is the argument.
## How to use a function
    To use a function, you call it by writing its name followed by parentheses ()
### Example
    Calling the len() function with a string argument
    word_length = len("Python") 
    print(word_length) This will print 6 i.e. the number of letter in "Python"
### Why functions are useful
    They make code more organized, readable, and reusable. 
    Also means you dont have to make things from scratch
### Where to learn about Python's built-in functions
