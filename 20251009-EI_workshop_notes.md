## Understanding Feedback 
* What is feedback
Information about reactions used as a `basis for improvement` 

* The challenge is that feedback sits at the crux of two core human needs, love and growth:

    * `Love & acceptance`

        The human need to feel love and acceptance. To be part of the group and not disrupt relationships or feel alienated.

    * `Learning and growing`

        The human desire to excel progress and develop new skills, abilities and capabilities

### Why is it important

* We cant see blindsides 
* Growth and learning
* Boosts motivation / performance 
* Communications
* relationships
* Goal Setting
* Decision making

### Why do we avoid it?
* Fear of harming relationships
* threats to self image / ego
* lack of effective communication skills

### Types 

Redzone - the soap drama 

Neutral - pass ag, insults, rude and unpleasant, complaining to others 

Green - I statement; feelings.

## Tools for feedback

`A A S K`

__A__ - Ask for permission to give feedback

    * respect for autonomy
    * Readiness to receive 
    * Tailor the message
    * Builds trust 
    * Enhancing Effectiveness 
    * Psychological safety 

`__A__` - `Actionable`.
    Feedback should be actionable. Avoid vague adjectives like “bad” or “good,”. They should be able to take immediate steps to act on your feedback

`__S__` - `Specific` clear with enough detail for them to understand it properly. Being specific helps them come up with steps to respond

`__k__` - `Kind` - safety - establish rapport. Remember the goal of feedback. It’s hard to receive feedback when dealing with the emotional hurt from unkind communication.

## Communication Styles
